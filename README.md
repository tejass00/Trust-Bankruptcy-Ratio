The Behavioural Economics of Goodwill: How Market Sentiment Becomes Accounting Loss
(June 15, 2025). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5297095)

 Core Formula
$$ TBR = \frac{\Delta Goodwill\ Impairment}{\Delta Negative\ Sentiment\ Index} $$

 Interpretation Thresholds
| TBR Value | Risk Level | Real-World Example |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| >1.0 | Terminal Insolvency | Air India (1.29) |
| 0.8-1.0 | Critical Impairment | Boeing (1.46) |
| <0.8 | Recoverable | Maggi (0.87) |

 Case Studies
- Air India: ₹1,200cr impairment @ TBR=1.29
- Boeing: $9.2B write-off @ TBR=1.46
- Wells Fargo: $14.5B loss @ TBR=1.31
